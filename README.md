# Project Title: kitter

## Abstract

Kitter is a clean and minimal looking social media app. I made it kind of like group chat format for my friends to use for sending strictly text chat only as it helps to keep focus on the things that matter.

I used Flutter for the front-end part of the app and Firebase for Backend. Firebase is a BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service). I used authentication (Email and Password) and the cloud storage (Cloud Firestore) services provided by Firebase.
